# Sashimi OS

Sashimi OS is a GNU/Linux distribution.


## Design Purposes

- Binary distributions rely too much on mirrors and/or CDN.
- Dpkg is a nice backend to cooperate with.
- Inherit the lightweight maintenance part from Gentoo.
- Avoid depending on Python, contrary to Gentoo.
- Allow opportunist use of deb artifacts from binary distributions.
