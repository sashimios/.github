# Sashimi OS

Sashimi OS is a GNU/Linux distribution.


## Ideology

- Binary distributions rely too much on mirrors and/or CDN.
- Dpkg is a nice backend to cooperate with.
- Inherit the lightweight maintenance part from Gentoo.
- Avoid depending on Python, contrary to Gentoo.
- Allow opportunist use of deb artifacts from binary distributions.


## Projects

- [sashimios/tree-sashimi](https://github.com/sashimios/tree-sashimi): The "official" source tree repository.
- [sashimios/spm-bash](https://github.com/sashimios/spm-bash): The SPM (Sashimi Package Manager) implementation written in shell script.
